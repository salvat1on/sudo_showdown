# sudo_showdown
A CTF that plays like a game , or  game that plays like a CTF.. you decide
Sudo Showdown is a CTF style game written in python. 
This game requires sudo to build each levels environment via docker.
Each environmant is torn down and deleted at the end of each level before the new level is built.
This game plays background music while you play. Use your own mp3 FIle if you like.. I suggest using a long one, just name it background_music.mp3 and place it in the assets folder
Each level contains a flag that must be submitted before progressing to the next level. Tested on kali linux

There are 13 levels total:

1) Sql injection
2) Command injection
3) File inclusion
4) Privilege escalation
5) Buffer overflow
6) XSS
7) RCE
8) Path traversal
9) CSRF
10) Steganography
11) Password cracking
12) Reverse shell
13) ROP exploit
